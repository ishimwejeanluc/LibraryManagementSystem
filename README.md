                                           AUCA Library Management System
This system helps the AUCA library manage book borrowing and user memberships. Users can create accounts, choose a membership plan (Gold, Silver, or Striver), and borrow books based on their membership limits. The system keeps track of borrowed books, due dates, and applies fines for late returns. Librarians can manage the book inventory, assign books to shelves, and track how many books are in each room. Administrators like the HOD, Dean, and Registrar can view system details but cannot borrow books or make changes.
